## Investment Decision Rules

The scoring engine evaluates 5 rules, each worth a maximum of 2 points:

| # | Rule | Threshold | Points |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | Revenue Growth YoY | > 10% = 2pts, 5–10% = 1pt, < 5% = 0pt | 0–2 |
| 2 | Profit Margin | > 15% = 2pts, 5–15% = 1pt, < 5% = 0pt | 0–2 |
| 3 | Low Debt | D/E < 1.0x = 2pts, 1–2x = 1pt, > 2x = 0pt | 0–2 |
| 4 | Positive News | ≥ 50% positive = 2pts, 25–49% = 1pt, < 25% = 0pt | 0–2 |
| 5 | Strong Cash Flow | FCF > 0 = 2pts, OCF > 0 = 1pt, both ≤ 0 = 0pt | 0–2 |

**Total: 10 points**

| Score | Decision |
|---|---|
| ≥ 8 | 🟢 **INVEST** |
| 5–7 | 🟡 **HOLD** |
|  < 5 | 🔴 **PASS** |

## Example Output (TSLA – hypothetical)

```json
{
  "scoring": {
    "score": 6,
    "max_score": 10,
    "recommendation": "HOLD",
    "decision_color": "amber",
    "summary": "A score of 6/10 indicates solid but not outstanding fundamentals.",
    "rules": [
      { "rule": "Revenue Growth", "points": 2,  "verdict": "PASS",    "actual_value": "18.8%" },
      { "rule": "Profit Margin",  "points": 1,  "verdict": "PARTIAL", "actual_value": "9.2%"  },
      { "rule": "Low Debt",       "points": 2,  "verdict": "PASS",    "actual_value": "0.8x"  },
      { "rule": "Positive News",  "points": 1,  "verdict": "PARTIAL", "actual_value": "38% positive" },
      { "rule": "Strong Cash Flow","points": 0, "verdict": "FAIL",    "actual_value": "-$1.50B FCF" }
    ]
  }
}
```

## Trade-offs

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| `yfinance` over paid APIs | Free, no registration required, rich data; unofficial so may occasionally be rate-limited |
| Rule-based scoring over ML | Completely transparent, auditable, and explainable – suitable for a research tool |
| SQLite database | Sufficient for a stateless research tool; upgrade to PostgreSQL for production |
| No user authentication | Research tool focus; easily added via Django's built-in auth |
| Partial credit (+1) rules | Avoids binary cliff-edges in scoring, produces more nuanced results |

## Future Improvements

- [ ] **PDF Report Export** – Download a full analysis as a branded PDF
- [ ] **Comparison Mode** – Analyse two tickers side by side
- [ ] **Portfolio Tracker** – Save multiple analyses and track score changes over time
- [ ] **Sector Benchmarking** – Compare metrics against sector median
- [ ] **Alerts** – Email/webhook notification when a tracked company's score changes
- [ ] **Historical Score Chart** – Track score over time as financials update
- [ ] **PostgreSQL + Redis** – Production-grade data persistence and caching
- [ ] **Docker** – Containerise for one-command deployment
- [ ] **Indian Stock Support** – NSE/BSE integration for Reliance, Infosys, etc.

## Deployment

### Development (local)
```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Production Checklist
1. Set `DEBUG=False` in `.env`
2. Set a strong `SECRET_KEY`
3. Set `ALLOWED_HOSTS` to your domain
4. Run `python manage.py collectstatic`
5. Use Gunicorn + Nginx or a PaaS like Railway/Render

```bash
pip install gunicorn
gunicorn wsgi:application --bind 0.0.0.0:8000
```
